# Project Overview

## Project Name

Things we should know about... Store Edition

## Project Description

At my ice cream store there always seems to be either thing that breakdown or things that are missing and we need to buy more. There are also generally things that my staff should let me know, but never do. The project will basically catalogue inputs of these bits of information in a gamified way.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I think this will be a good project to work on getting feedback from the end user as I go. My goal is to make internal communication within our team more fun and rewarding, so maybe they will be able to give me advice on the UX and the features that would be useful.

### Weaknesses:

Not completely sure about would additional features will make this "fun," hoping to accomplish building a rough MVP would be and use feedback from the team to have something more useful for them to inevitably use.

### Opportunities:

This project gives me the opportunity to build something that I can use for my personal life, including work. I think it could potentially solve an issue I face at work and, might help the team as well have better, more fun communication.

### Threats:

Usually not the best at debugging, I think that this will be a good opportunity to practice and get better at it. I also am not completely sure about all the features I want to add, but I think it will be good to get feedback as I go with our team.
